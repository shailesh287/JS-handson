    <h3>1.Whats is Javascript?</h3>
    <p>
      Javascript is a dynamic programming language. And is the most popular
      language worldwide. JS is highest paid job in US and other countries. JS
      is used everywhere now. Web apps and Mobile applications can be created
      through JS. HTML&CSS are static. JS is used in Netflix, Wallmart, PayPal
      and so on.
    </p>

    <h3>2.What is JavaScript Runtime Environment?</h3>
    <p>
      Javascript run-time environment is the place where our program gets
      executed.It determines what global objects your program can access and it
      can also impact how it runs. JS run-time environment consists of
      API's,Javascript Engine,Callback Queue and Microtask Queue.
    </p>

    <h3>3.What is JavaScript Engine?</h3>
    <p>
      Javascript Engine is software component that executes javascript
      code.Different browsers have different javascript Engines.For ex. Google
      Chrome has V8 Engine,Internet explorer have Chakra and Mozilla have Spider
      Monkey.The architecture of V8 engine is shown below.

    <h3>4. What is Execution in Javascript?</h3>

    <ol>
      Javascript execution context is divided into two parts
      <li>Creation Phase</li>
      <li>Execution Phase</li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <h4>Creation Phase:</h4>
    <p>
      This is the initial phase of Global execution content.Here all variables
      and functions are given memory allocation ie. stored in heap memory and
      values assigned as undefined.The global execution context is pushed into
      the callstack and it remains there until all the code gets executed.After
      complete execution global execution context gets popped from callstack.
    </p>

    <h4>Execution Phase :</h4>
    <p>
      This is the final phase of global execution context.Here code is executed
      line by line and the original values are assigned to the variables and to
      the functions at this stage. When function gets executed a seperate
      execution context gets executed ie. function execution which is pushed
      into the stack ie. at the top of the global execution context.Here the
      code inside the function gets excuted. After the execution of the function
      the function execution context gets popped out of the callstack and the
      rest of the code gets excuted.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h4>Example</h4>
    <pre>
        let x = 10;

        function timesTen(a){
            return a * 10;
        }

        let y = timesTen(x);

        console.log(y); // 100
    </pre>
