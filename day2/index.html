    <h1>DAY 2</h1>
    <h3>1. What are the different types of variables in JS</h3>
    <pre>
       There are 3 types of variables in JS,they are:

       1. Var 
       2. let
       3. const

       Var: 
       Var is a global scope variable.
       Var can reassigned.
       Var can be redeclared.
       Var can be modified later.

       let:
       let is a block scope.
       let cannot be reassigned.
       let cannot be redeclared.
       let can be modified later.
       
       const: 
       const is a block scope.
       const cannot be reassigned.
       canst cannot be redeclared.
       const cannot be modified later.
    </pre>
    <br />
    <h3>2. What is Hoisting in JS</h3>
    <p>
      Once JavaScript file comes into the browser all the variables are
      allocated memory which is <b>undefined</b> and that phase of time i.e.
      before the execution of the code is known as <b>Hoisting</b>. When the
      memory has been declared to the variables. <br /><br />
      note: <b>Only the declaration are hoisted not initialisation.</b>
    </p>
    <h3>3. what is closure</h3>
    <p>
      Any function maintaining lexical scoping is called as closures.Here the
      function will try to access the variables in local scope,if they dont find
      it then it will search it in the outer scope and still if it fails to find
      it will search in gloabl scope and finally if it is not found then it will
      return undefined.
    </p>
    <h3>4. What is Temporal Dead Zone</h3>
    <p>
      It is the time between the hoisting and the initialization of
      variables.Let and const are hoisted but they fall into different space
      called temporal dead zone.
